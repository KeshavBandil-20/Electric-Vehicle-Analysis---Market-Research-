# Electric-Vehicle-Analysis---Market-Research-
To analyze electric vehicle (EV) data and extract meaningful, actionable insights using Python, statistical techniques, and data visualization. This project covers filtering logic, outlier detection, hypothesis testing, and building a custom EV recommendation engine.

📊 Key Tasks & Highlights
✅ Task 1: Filter EVs by Budget and Range
Filtered EVs under 350,000 PLN with ≥ 400 km range.
Grouped by manufacturer and computed average battery capacity.
✅ Task 2: Detect Outliers in Energy Consumption
Used IQR method to identify abnormal consumption values.
✅ Task 3: Visualize Battery Capacity vs Range
Created scatter plots and correlation heatmap.
Found a strong positive relationship.
✅ Task 4: EV Recommendation Class
Built a Python class that takes user input and suggests top 3 EVs.
Interactive and real-world application of data filtering.
✅ Task 5: Hypothesis Testing
Conducted two-sample t-test on engine power (Tesla vs Audi).
Revealed statistically significant performance differences.
🧰 Tools & Technologies
Python (Jupyter Notebook)
Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Statistical testing (ttest_ind)
Object-oriented programming
📈 Recommendations
Promote high-efficiency EVs in the 300–350k range with 450+ km range.
Target Tesla and Audi customers differently based on performance vs efficiency.
Offer real-time tools using recommender logic for EV comparison.
